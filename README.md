# Rust
Contains code in Rust language using the official book and my own experiments. Book can be found here https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

# Important note
Before running any binary, clean and build the project because some binaries are compiled on x86 and some on arm64.
<br>1. cargo clean<br>
2. cargo run (or cargo build)<br>
